# founders-and-coders-project1
website about one of my hobbies employing basic use of html, CSS and javascript

The planning phase entailed me formalising my ideas surrounding fitness and physical culture, conceptualising the site structure and 
then writting the text by hand as a rough draft. I also regularly referred back to the project breif and made notes for ideas about the site design.

The building phase entailed me first creating an over arching structure to my website that included my rough draft text I then added in hyperlinks, images
and the CSS style elements and finally I added the javascript element for the time and date.  

The debugging phase entailed me making visual refinements using CSS style attributes to make text adjustable to screen size and spell checking my text
