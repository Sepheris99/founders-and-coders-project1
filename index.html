    <p><div class="text">
        Ever since I was a a child I have been fascinated by movement and physicality. 
        From martial arts and dance to gymnastics and athletics. I have explored all sorts of different 
        physical art forms, even contemporary mime, and whilst studying them,
        I have noticed common elements that sit at each of their foundations.

        <h2 id="titles"><i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell">Strength</i></h2>

    <p><div class="text">
      Developing strength takes time, a long time. To develop it you must take yourself close to approx.
      85% absolute intensity for the target tissue. In laymans terms that means taking yourself to a point 
      near the physiological failure and rupturing of said tissue. In your bodies terms, this is a
      near death experience. You do this, and then rest to allow your body to reinforce those tissues so 
      that you come back stronger.</div></p>
        <p><div class="text">You do this for days, weeks, months, years and decades allowing for adaption in all parts of your body,
      nerve, muscle, tendon, ligamens and bone all the while learning about yourself. Learning your tolerances
      and pains and what your bodily sensations mean. It also teaches you patience, diligence and mental fortitude
       as well as instilling the skill of self forgiveness for you will fail continously upwards. 
    These qualities carry over into all manner of disciples across life and are the true boon of strength training.</div></p>

    <h2 id="titles"><em><strong>Conditioning</strong></em></h2>
    
    <p><div class="text">
        Conditioning is the ability to express strength over long periods of time continuously. 
        Without conditioning expression of strength becomes very physiologically expensive and the
        recovery times long, thus diminishing the utility of strength. Conditioning allows you to 
        to perform acts of strength day after day with lower risk of injury or fatigue.</div></p>
      <p><div class="text">
        To improve conditioning firstly it is important to note that it is specific to the manner in which it is
        developed, if your goal is conditioning for weightlifing you must develop it using a barbell
        or dumbbells, if you want it for cycling you must train on a bike, if for running you must run
        (outdoors as treadmills do not allow your body to adapt to forward momentum of the torso) and so 
        on and so forth.</div></p>
     <p><div class="text">
        secondly I reccomend that you use approx. 85% of the intensity used to develop strength.
        for example, if your 100% absolute intensity (the most weight you could possibly lift for a 
        single repetition) for the bench press was 100kg you would use 85kg to develop strength with,
        and then 72.5kg to develop conditioning in that same movement. It is not recommended to train
        both strength and conditioning concurrently but rather individually in alternating 6 week cycles.

    <h2 id="titles"><em><strong>Mobility</strong></em></h2>
    
    <p><div class="text">
       Mobility is the raw quality of flexibility brought under control by the neuro-muscular system. 
       Instead of needing an external object or force to pull or push you into a shape your mind can 
       simply will it to occur. It allows the most avenues of expression for strength and conditioning.</div></p>
      <p><div class="text">
       To train this quality you must train your joints through full ranges of motion applying the rules
       of strength and conditioning as you go. It is worth noting that whilst training joints in isolation
       will convey benefits, for this quality it is best to have a good understanding of how body parts 
       and joints work together in kinetic chains. This will greatly accelerate the speed at which this
       quality can be developed.</div></p>

    <h2 class="titles"><em><strong>Coordination</strong></em></h2>

    <p><div class="text">
        Coordination is the glue that binds the other three qualities together, creating a synergy between
        them that ultimately leads to physical capacity worth far more than the sum of their individual parts.</div></p>
       <p><div class="text">
        For this to be developed, gradually increasing the number of joints involved in a movement and the speed
        at which the movement can be performed correctly will improve coordination.
        There are several key elements to coordination that include:</div></p>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>hand eye coordination - throwing, catching, juggling etc</li>
            <li>whole body movements - running, jumping, climbing etc</li>
            <li>balancing - single leg and on hands</li>
        </ul>

    <p><div class="text">
        The world of fitness and physical culture is broad and deep. It can be easy for any newcomer 
        to become completely overwhelmed by all the information out there that more often than not seems 
        to contradict itself more often than not, however there are a few voices that I believe cut through 
        the mealstrom and offer consistently intelligent programing and information;</div></p>
