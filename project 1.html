    <p>
        Ever since I was a a child I have been fascinated by movement and physicality. 
        From martial arts and dance to gymnastics and athletics, I have explored all sorts of different 
        physical art forms, <em>even contemporary mime</em>, and whilst studying them all,
        I have noticed common elements that sit at each of their foundations.

        <h2><em><strong>Strength</strong></em></h2>

   
    <p>
      Developing strength takes time, a long time. To develop it you must take yourself close to approx.
      85% absolute intensity for the target tissue. In laymans terms that means taking yourself to a point 
      near the physiological failure and rupturing of said tissue. In your bodies terms, this is a
      near death experience. You do this, and then rest to allow your body to reinforce those tisses so 
      that you come back stronger.
          You do this for days, weeks, months, years and decades allowing for adaption in all parts of yourself,
      nerve, muscle, tendon, ligamens and bone all the while learning about yourself. Learning your tolerances
      and pains and what your bodily sensations mean. It also teaches you patience, diligence and mental fortitude
       as well as instilling the skill of self forgiveness for you will fail continously upwards. 
    These qualities carry over into all manner of disciples across life and are the true boon of strength training.

    <h2><em><strong>Conditioning</strong></em></h2>
    
    <p>
        Conditioning is the ability to express strength over long periods of time continuously. 
        without conditioning expression of strength becomes very physiologically expensive and the
        recovery times long thus diminishing the utility of strength. Conditioning allows you to 
        to perform acts of strength day after day with lower risk of injury or fatigue.

    <h2><em><strong>Mobility</strong></em></h2>
    
    <p>
       Mobility is the raw quality of flexibility brought under control by the neuro-muscular system. 
       instead of needing an external object or force to pull or push you into a shape your mind can 
       simply will it to occur. It allows the most avenues of expression for strength and conditioning.

    <h2><em><strong>Coordination</strong></em></h2>

    <p>
        Coordination is the glue that binds the other three qualities together, creating a synergy between
        them that ultimately leads to physical capacity worth far more than the sum of their individual parts. There are 
        several key elements to coordination that include: 
        <ul>
            <li>hand eye coordination - throwing, catching, juggling etc</li>
            <li>whole body movements - running, jumping, climbing etc</li>
            <li>balancing - single leg and on hands</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><em><strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong></em></h2>

    <p>
        The world of fitness and physical culture is broad and deep. It can be easy for any newcomer 
        to become completely overwhelmed by all the information out there that more often than not seems 
        contradictory however there are a few voices that I believe cut through the mealstrom and offer 
        consistently intelligent programing and information;
